# (a really very bad) encryptor
part of the turing school prework

The "encryption.rb" file is the most recent version. It's... very, very in-progress. 
Currently it is possible to select encryption, and only encryption.

To do, if time permits: 
 - continue making changes for clarity / ease of modification
 - figure out a way to add file encrypt/decrypt to this version
 - attempt other jumpstart lab challenges -- MD5, rotation rotations etc.
 - maybe build the cracker from the jumpstart lab thing back in?
 - add the ability to navigate within the app (move from encryption to decryption and back without having to relaunch)

The "encryptor.rb" file satisfies the requirements of the jumpstart lab assignment, plus it has passwords and file I/O. 
It is a *mess*. But it works!
